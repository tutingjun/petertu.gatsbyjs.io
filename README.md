# This is my personal website using Gatsby

This website is built using Gatsby Framework with the help of React, Node.js, and GraphiQL. It is hosted on Gatsby Cloud. This project took inspiration from [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com). (GitHub repo: [Link](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com)) Currently, it supports integrating a `.md` page into the blog post. The project is still under development and will have a more comprehensive write-out when the first version is ready.
