Cosign is an American Sign Language app developed by `OpenCV` and `TensorFlow`. It can recognize the live video feed of the userâ€™s American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and convert them into individual letters of the English alphabet. Cosign also allows users to spell out full words and sentences letter by letter through sign language.
